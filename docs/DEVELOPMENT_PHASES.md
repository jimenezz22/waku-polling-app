---

## **Phase 4: Core Poll Functionality** 🗳️

**Goal**: Implement poll creation and display features

### Tasks:
1. Create PollCreation component with form validation and Light Push publishing
2. Develop PollList and PollCard components with proper state management
3. Add minimal, clean CSS styling following design principles

### Required Documentation:
- 📄 [`docs/COMPONENT_STRUCTURE.md`](./COMPONENT_STRUCTURE.md) - Component design patterns and structure

### Deliverables:
- Functional poll creation interface
- Poll list display with real-time updates
- Clean, beginner-friendly UI styling
- Form validation and error handling

---

## **Phase 5: Voting System** ✅

**Goal**: Implement voting interface and results display

### Tasks:
1. Create VoteInterface component with voting buttons and Light Push integration
2. Implement VoteResults component with real-time result calculation and visualization
3. Add vote deduplication logic to prevent duplicate voting

### Required Documentation:
- 📄 [`docs/VOTING_LOGIC.md`](./VOTING_LOGIC.md) - Voting mechanics and validation rules
- 📄 [`docs/COMPONENT_STRUCTURE.md`](./COMPONENT_STRUCTURE.md) - UI component patterns
- 📄 [`docs/IDENTITY_SYSTEM.md`](./IDENTITY_SYSTEM.md) - Identity-based vote validation

### Deliverables:
- Interactive voting interface
- Real-time vote count updates
- Results visualization with progress bars
- Duplicate vote prevention system
- User voting status tracking

---

## **Phase 6: Final Integration & Polish** ✨

**Goal**: Complete application with status monitoring and comprehensive testing

### Tasks:
1. Create Header and Footer components with connection status and error handling
2. Develop custom React hooks (usePolls, useVotes, useVoting, useIdentity)
3. Conduct comprehensive integration testing of all features

### Required Documentation:
- 📄 [`docs/COMPONENT_STRUCTURE.md`](./COMPONENT_STRUCTURE.md) - Status component patterns
- 📄 [`docs/STATE_MANAGEMENT.md`](./STATE_MANAGEMENT.md) - Custom hooks implementation
- All previous documentation for integration testing

### Deliverables:
- Complete application with status monitoring
- Reusable custom hooks for Waku operations
- Error handling and loading states
- Comprehensive feature testing
- Basic reconnection handling
- Ready-to-demo application

---

## **Development Guidelines**

### Core Principles:
- **Simplicity First**: Minimal dependencies, clear code structure
- **Beginner Friendly**: Well-commented, easy to understand
- **Demo Optimized**: Features can be demonstrated incrementally
- **Core Functionality Focus**: No over-engineering or unnecessary complexity

### File Organization:
```
src/
├── components/         # React UI components
├── hooks/             # Custom React hooks
├── services/          # Waku integration services
├── utils/             # Utility functions
├── styles/            # CSS styling
├── App.tsx            # Main application component
└── main.tsx           # React entry point
```

### Testing Approach:
- Test each phase incrementally
- Verify Waku protocols work independently and together
- Ensure real-time updates function properly
- Validate error handling and edge cases

### Success Criteria:
Each phase should result in a working, demonstrable increment that builds upon previous phases while maintaining application stability and user experience.
